<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
<p>This is the personal page of Cole Le Mahieu. As a PhD candidate at the University of Kansas, I do research in experimental nuclear physics. Specifically, I analyze data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to learn more about the structure of protons and neutorns and the strong nuclear force.</p>
