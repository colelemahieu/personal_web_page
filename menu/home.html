    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      This is the personal page of Cole Le Mahieu. As a PhD candidate at the University of Kansas, I conduct research in experimental nuclear physics by analyzing data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). My work focuses on better understanding the substructure of protons and neutrons.
      As an experimental physicist, my primary work involves writing scripts to analyze and visualize large datasets. After obtaining my PhD, I will seek to apply these technical skills in data analysis and software positions in the industry.

      I enjoy spending time with my wife, Lauren, and our two energetic cats, Tonks and Kirk. I also enjoy reading a wide range of genres including science fiction, history, and the classics; a few of my favorite authors include Ray Bradbury, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Fyodor Dostoevsky.
