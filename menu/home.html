      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a recent PhD graduate from the experimental nuclear physics group at the University of Kansas. My research utilized data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to better understand the substructure of protons and neutrons.

        As an experimental physicist, my primary work involved writing scripts to analyze and visualize large datasets. After having obtained my PhD, I hope to apply these technical skills in data analysis and software positions in industry.

        I enjoy spending time with my wife, Lauren, and our two energetic cats, Tonks and Kirk. I also enjoy reading a wide range of genres including science fiction, history, and the classics; a few of my favorite authors include Ray Bradbury, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Fyodor Dostoevsky.
