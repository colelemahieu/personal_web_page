    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      This is the personal page of Cole Le Mahieu. As a PhD candidate at the University of Kansas, I conduct research in experimental nuclear 
      physics by analyzing data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). My work focuses on better 
      understanding the substructure of protons and neutrons.
