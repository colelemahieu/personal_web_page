    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      This is the personal page of Cole Le Mahieu. As a PhD candidate at the University of Kansas, I conduct research in experimental nuclear 
      physics by analyzing data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). My work focuses on better 
      understanding the substructure of protons and neutrons.

      In my free time I enjoy spending time with my wife, Lauren, and our two energetic cats, Tonks and Kirk. I enjoy reading 
      science fiction and the classics; a few of my favorite authors include Ray Bradbury, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Fyodor Dostoevsky.
