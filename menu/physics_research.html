<p>During my PhD program at the University of Kansas, I was a part of the experimental nuclear physics group. Our group analyzed data from the Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful particle accelerator. This accelerator, located between the French-Swiss border, is capable of colliding protons and heavy ions at relativistic speeds.</p>
