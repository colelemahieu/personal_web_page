<h1>Book Project</h1>
<p>Since 2007*, I have kept track of every book I have read. This provides a nice opportunity to practice some simple Python and web development skills. Various statistics are presented below based on book genre, page number, etc. </p>
<p class="note">*Technically, each year refers to the time duration from one birthday in that year to the next. This unfortunate documentation choice was began in grade school and is too late to stop now.</p>
