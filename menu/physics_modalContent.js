    <p>While at CERN in the Fall of 2022, I helped prepare the CMS Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs) for data taking. 
    There are two ZDCs, each located 140 meters down the beamline from either side of the CMS interaction point. Their 
    purpose is to record energy deposits from neutral particles (photons and neutrons) resulting from heavy ion collisions. 
    Because of their neutral charge, these particles continue traveling down the beamline, unaffected by CMS magents, until 
    they reach the ZDCs.</p>
