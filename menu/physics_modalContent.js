    <i style="color: #33658A;">ZDC Data Acquisition</i>
    <p>In the Fall of 2022, I traveled to CERN to help prepare the CMS Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs) for data taking. 
    CMS has two ZDC detectors, each located 140 meters down the beamline from either side of the interaction point. Their 
    purpose is to detect energy deposits from the neutral particles (photons and neutrons) resulting from heavy ion collisions. 
    Because of their neutral charge, these particles are unaffected by CMS magnets and continue traveling down the beamline 
    until they hit the ZDCs.</p>
    <p>For my first task at CERN, I tested the performance of one of these ZDCs above ground. After operational tests, the 
    detector was lowered into the tunnel and I assisted with installation. This involved debugging the ZDC's data acquisition system 
    to ensure successful transfer of data from the detector to above-ground electronics.</p>

   <p>CMS is one of several detectors located around the ring of the Large Hadron Collider. It acts as a sort of camera, taking
   pictures of high energy particle collisions and helping physicists understand more about elementary particles and the forces
   that govern their interactions.</p>
